- I'm Isaiah
	- Favorite game is Cave Story. Got me in to development. Reference the game in my works a lot.
		- Probably the biggest fan of Cave Story on campus. Also probably the only one since no one knows about it.
	- I have experience in all parts of game development with programming being my strongest.
	- Worked on many games but only released one for a Game Jam (Smell The Air)
	- Most recent project is an exporter for moving models from Blender to GMS2

- Hunter
	- This is the game I worked on with a team of 6 people for the Game Dev Club last semester. A hack-n-slash platformer.
	- I was a programmer, artist, and did a bit of sounds for the project.
	- Since our team is looking to be busy this semester the project's going on a hiatus. Indefinetly? idk.
	- We have the link in the club Discord if you want to try it.

- Strike!!!
	- What I have for today
