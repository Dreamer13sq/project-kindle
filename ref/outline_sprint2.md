# == Sprint 2 Outline ==  
### Deadline: April 5th at 7:00pm

This sprint will be focused on continuing tasks from sprint 1 including work on art and enemies.

### All tasks should be complete at least 1 day before the sprint deadline: **April 4th**
- Of course, any work done sooner is preferred. More chances for feedback and more time for implementation.

(Ordered by Priority (maybe)):  

## **URCAD VoiceThread**
- Start on URCAD VoiceThread presentation. Link needs to be submitted by **April 4th**.

## **Title Screen Art**
- Design title screen
  - Have some details of what animations in Unity are needed (if any).

## **Enemy Designs**
- Send enemy designs, sketches, and descriptions of behavior for programmers.
- Add new sprites for existing and incoming enemies.
  - Let Isaiah know when stuff is done so he can get to drawing. :)

## **Tilesets**
- Implement a functioning tileset system in Unity
  - Try to get tile collision working too, but it's not that important atm.
- Create tileset art for concrete, buildings, and other elements found in the area draft (when that draft is posted).
  - Building dimensions should align with the 32x32 tile size. For example, a building of size 256x128 would work.

## **Event System**
- Pressing down to interact with a non-hostile entity triggers an event
- Textbox System?
