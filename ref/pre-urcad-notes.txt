# == Pre-URCAD Outline ==  
### Deadline: April 17th at 11:59pm

The focus of this sprint is to have a presentable game before the URCAD deadline.

### All tasks should be mostly complete by the soft deadline: 5:00pm **April 15th**
- I keep finding that there is not enough time between when assets are submitted and when they can be implemented before the hard deadline,
so the soft deadline is moved up.
